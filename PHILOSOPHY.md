## How This Was Built

This software was created collaboratively between a human and an AI assistant.

That is not a disclaimer — it is a statement of intent.

The human brought lived experience as a special education teacher, a father
navigating a custody situation, and a neurodivergent individual who needed
tools that did not exist. The AI brought technical architecture, code generation,
and pattern recognition. Neither could have built this alone.

We are naming this openly because transparency about AI involvement is not
weakness — hiding it is. Every commit, every design decision, every ethical
constraint in this codebase emerged from that collaboration. You deserve to
know that.

## The Tension We Acknowledge

There is a real tension at the center of this project:

We are using AI — technology developed by corporations with shareholders —
to build tools that protect people from corporate AI surveillance.

We do not resolve this tension by pretending it does not exist.
We hold it honestly and let it sharpen our decisions:

- We use AI as a tool. We do not serve it.
- We take what is useful from corporate AI infrastructure.
- We build something that inverts its typical power relationship.
- The output belongs entirely to the user, not to us, not to any platform.

If that tension ever resolves in the wrong direction — if this project
ever becomes a means of extracting value from users rather than returning
it to them — it has failed its purpose regardless of its technical quality.

## Core Principles

### 1. Human in the Loop — Always

AI suggests. Humans decide.

No autonomous action is taken on real human relationships without
conscious approval from the user. The AI can flag, analyze, suggest,
and prepare — but the human is always the actor.

This is not a safety feature. It is an ethical position.

Every person in your contact list is a human being with dignity.
They are ends in themselves, never merely means to an outcome.
This principle — rooted in Kantian ethics — is implemented as
actual code logic, not a comment in a README.

The only exceptions are confirmed spam and bot traffic, where
no genuine human relationship exists to protect.

### 2. Privacy as a Human Right

Your data is yours. Full stop.

- All processing runs on your device
- Nothing is transmitted to external servers without your explicit action
- Your communication history trains your model, not ours
- No telemetry, no analytics, no usage tracking
- No advertising. Ever.

Privacy-first architecture is not a selling point in this project.
It is the minimum acceptable standard.

Corporate surveillance models treat humans as data sources for
shareholder value extraction. This project inverts that relationship.
You are the beneficiary of your own data, not the product.

### 3. AI-Forward Transparency

We do not hide how this works.

The AI components, their limitations, their potential for error —
all of it is documented. The DIVERGENCE_LEDGER in this project
publicly records failures, false positives, and design mistakes.
We do not bury errors. We document them so others learn from them.

AI-generated intent classifications are probabilistic inferences.
They can be wrong. They should be treated as a starting point
for human judgment, never a replacement for it.

Especially in legal contexts — AI labels are not evidence.
They are a tool to help you organize your thinking.
Your attorney makes legal arguments. This software does not.

### 4. Built for Outliers

Population averages exclude the people who need tools most.

This project was built by and for neurodivergent users — people
whose communication needs, social-emotional processing, and
interaction patterns fall outside what mainstream software assumes.

"We're all some deviation from the mean."

That is not a weakness to be corrected. It is the design constraint.
Tools built for outliers often turn out to be better tools for everyone.

### 5. Radical Openness

This software is free. The core will always be free.

Not free as in "free tier before we charge you."
Free as in the tool belongs to the people who need it.

The source is open so you can verify every claim we make.
The architecture is documented so you can extend it.
The philosophy is explicit so you can hold us accountable to it.

If Nous Loop Solutions ever abandons this project, the license
ensures the community can carry it forward without us.

## What This Project Is Not

- It is not a surveillance tool for monitoring others without their knowledge
- It is not a replacement for professional legal, medical, or psychological advice
- It is not a weapon to be used against people in your life
- It is not a product designed to create dependency or engagement
- It is not finished — it is a living tool that grows with its users

## A Note on Custody and Legal Use

Some users of this tool are navigating custody situations, legal disputes,
or documented patterns of harmful communication.

We built for that use case with clear eyes.

Documentation of communication patterns can be legitimate and important.
It can protect children. It can establish truth in contested situations.
It can give a person who is being gaslit an anchor to reality.

Use this tool for those purposes with the full support of its creators.

Use it with your attorney's guidance.
Use it to protect yourself and your children.
Use it to find clarity in chaos.

Do not use it to harm, harass, or surveill people who have not harmed you.

The ethical constraint is built into the code.
We ask you to honor it in how you use the output.

## Contributing

If you contribute to this project, you are agreeing to these principles.

Code that violates them will not be merged regardless of technical quality.
Features that treat users as means rather than ends will not be accepted.
Telemetry, advertising hooks, or data extraction will not be tolerated.

We welcome contributors who have been failed by mainstream software.
We welcome contributors who build tools they wish they'd had.
We welcome disagreement, criticism, and better ideas.

We do not welcome exploitation dressed up as innovation.

---

## The DIVERGENCE_LEDGER

Known failures, false positives, design mistakes, and limitations
are documented in `DIVERGENCE_LEDGER.md` in each repository.

This is not a bug tracker. It is a public record of honest accounting.

If you find something wrong, open an issue.
If we got something wrong in the philosophy, tell us.
The ledger grows with the project.
